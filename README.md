# NS-3 Dumbbell Topology Simulator for Congestion Control Testing

## Overview

This ns-3 simulator script creates a dumbbell topology, which is commonly used for testing congestion control algorithms. The dumbbell topology consists of two subnets connected by a bottleneck link, forming a shape resembling a dumbbell.
